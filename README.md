# Rock_Paper_Scissors

It is a telegram bot which plays "rock paper scissors" with you

I used pyTelegramBotAPI to create this bot 

To make this code work you need:
$ First of all sign up in Telegram, if you don't have an account.
$ Create telegram bot. It is very easy u can find the instructions in the internet.
$ After you created a bot, copy its token.
$ Go to RPSbot.py and on line 7 and replace word "TOKEN" with token you copied.
$ Execute your code, start chat with bot, type command /start in the chat and have fun.
