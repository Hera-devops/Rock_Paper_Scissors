# Rock_Paper_Scissors

It is a telegram bot which plays "rock paper scissors" with you

I used pyTelegramBotAPI to create this bot 

To make your bot work you need:
1- First of all sign up in Telegram, if you don't have an account.
2- Create telegram bot. It is very easy u can find the instructions in the internet.
3- After you created a bot, copy its token.
4- Go to RPSbot.py and on line 7 and replace word "TOKEN" with token you copied.
5- Execute your code, start chat with bot, type command /start in the chat and have fun. 

For this project I used: Windows 10 OS, pythton 3.7.5, pyTelegramBotAPI 3.7.2
